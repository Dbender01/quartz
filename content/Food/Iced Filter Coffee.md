- Grind a little finer than usual 
-  65g of coffee per liter of water
- 40% of the weight of the brew should be ice

- rinse filter paper in sink to avoid heating the decanter

bloom for 45 seconds 2-3x the weight

brew 2-3 minutes 

swirl at the end to melt all ice. Pour over ice cubes



20ish grams of coffee is usually 320 g for the brew


For me I'll try this
- 21.5 grams of coffee and 320 target brew

128 grams of ice 

192 grams of water

45 sec bloom of  60 grams of water

try to stretch the rest of the water at least 2 minutes
