### [Some general rules](https://glutenfreeonashoestring.com/how-to-make-gluten-free-bread/)
- Measure your dry ingredients by weight, not volume
- Make sure all ingredients are thoroughly blended
    - you can try using a food processor fitted with the steel blade. stand mixer is ideal
- Gluten substitutes are vital for making gluten free bread that holds together like xanthan gum
- Don't bake gluten free bread without an oven thermometer.
- Use the right gluten free flour blend to bake gluten free bread
- Yeast bread rises slower in cool, dry environments
- Make sure your bread dough doesn't dry out
- Set your yeast up for success.
- Don't let a boxed gluten free bread mix discourage you



And don't worry about over-mixing. There's no gluten to ‘overwork.' If your end result has a really tight crumb and seems crumbly, it's not that you overworked the dough. Your hydration level was likely too low

When yeast gives off carbon dioxide during the baking process, [gluten acts like a cloak](https://food52.com/blog/5036-demystifying-yeast) and suspends the bubbles.


I don't bother having the oven calibrated, since it will just drift out of calibration again. Instead, I use a simple analog oven thermometer that's easy, cheap, essential. I **==just replace it at least twice a year,==** and never worry whether my oven temperature is accurate.

most often bake my gluten free bread with Better Batter's classic gluten free flour blend. It's such a versatile blend, and it's always worked beautifully for any recipe that's called for an all purpose gf flour.

But surviving is different from thriving. Yeast in bread dough needs a few conditions to thrive:

- Enough moisture (without enough moisture, or if your raw dough loses too much moisture, the yeast won't be active)
- Enough time (yeast will rise more slowly at lower temperatures, but it will rise given enough time)
- Freshness (check the date on your yeast and don't use anything past its freshness date)


There are a few conditions that will inhibit the growth of your yeast:

- Too much salt (don't add yeast and salt in at the same time, and don't overmeasure your salt, which inhibits yeast growth)
- Too much sugar (which will absorb liquid in the dough; a proper sweet yeast bread recipe will already have accounted for that by adding more yeast)
- Too much heat (I do _not_ recommend setting your bread dough to rise in an oven that's on, even if you're certain it's only set to 100°F; most ovens won't retain a temperature setting that low and your yeast will probably die)
