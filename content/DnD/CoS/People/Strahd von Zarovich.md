Strahd von Zarovich is a prominent figure in the dark and mysterious realm of Barovia. He is a formidable vampire lord known for his compelling charm, shrewd intelligence, and an enduring fixation that spans centuries. As the dominant figure in the shadowed world of Barovia, Strahd's enigmatic past and motivations unfold as travelers brave the eerie and treacherous landscapes of his domain.

Strahd von Zarovich resides in Castle Ravenloft, a foreboding and imposing fortress that looms over the land of Barovia. This massive castle is perched atop a high cliff and shrouded in an eerie mist, adding to its ominous appearance. Within its walls are labyrinthine corridors, grand halls, and mysterious chambers, creating an atmosphere of gothic splendor and dread.

As the ruler of Barovia, Strahd wields absolute authority, and his dominion extends over the land and its inhabitants. He enforces his rule with an iron grip, and the people of Barovia live under his shadow, their lives steeped in fear and uncertainty. Strahd's control is maintained through his dark powers, his loyal minions, and a pervasive sense of isolation, leaving the realm trapped in a perpetual state of gloom and despair.
