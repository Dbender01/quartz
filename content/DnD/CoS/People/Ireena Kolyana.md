![[Ireena_Kolyana_art.png]]

Ireena Kolyana hails from the village of Barovia, where she once lived a peaceful life with her family. Her father, Kolyan Indirovich, was the respected Burgomaster (mayor) of the village, known for his dedication to the well-being of his people. Ireena's brother, Ismark Kolyanovich, was a capable and strong-willed young man who looked up to his father as a role model.

Ireena's life took a dark turn when Strahd von Zarovich, the vampire lord ruling over Barovia, became infatuated with her. With Strahd's relentless pursuit and the growing danger in the village, Ireena made the difficult decision to leave the village of Barovia and seek refuge in the town of Vallaki, hoping for greater safety. Her father and brother, while initially torn about the decision, ultimately supported her in this choice, knowing the peril Strahd posed to their family.

In Vallaki, Ireena tried to find solace, but her hopes were shattered when a dangerous coup occurred in the town. This upheaval resulted in the death of the Baron, further highlighting the pervasive chaos and instability that plagued the land of Barovia.

After the turmoil in Vallaki, Ireena, Father Lucian, and a few surviving guards undertook a perilous journey back to the village of Barovia.  Their hope was to reunite with their Ireena's Brother, Ismark, and face the ever-present threat of Strahd with renewed determination and a  much largerr group of trained guards.
