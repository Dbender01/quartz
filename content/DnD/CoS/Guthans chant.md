Here are some magic items from the Dungeon Master's Guide that could be tied to evil druids or fallen adventurers who fought them:

1. Staff of the Woodlands: This staff is a powerful tool for druids, allowing them to cast various nature-themed spells and summon creatures. It could be an item used by an evil druid or taken from a defeated one.

2. Ring of Animal Influence: This ring grants the wearer the ability to communicate with animals and influence their behavior. It could be a treasured possession of a fallen adventurer who was skilled in dealing with nature-based threats.

3. Cloak of Elvenkind: This magical cloak grants advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and makes it easier for the wearer to hide. It could have been worn by an adventurer who infiltrated the evil druids' lair.

4. Amulet of Health: This amulet increases the wearer's Constitution score, providing additional hit points and better fortitude against poison or disease. It might have belonged to a fallen adventurer who had to endure the toxic environments created by evil druids.

5. Scimitar of Speed: This magical scimitar allows its wielder to make an additional attack as a bonus action and increases their speed in combat. It could have been taken from a dangerous druid-turned-foe during a fierce battle.

6. Robe of Stars: This enchanted robe allows its wearer to release starlight that damages enemies and provides various protective abilities. It could have been left behind by an adventurer who sacrificed themselves while fighting against malevolent druids.

7. Necklace of Adaptation: This necklace grants its wearer immunity to harmful gases, extreme temperatures, and lack of air, making it useful in environments manipulated by evil druids. It may have belonged to an adventurer who explored their lair before meeting their fate.

Remember, you can always modify these items or create your own unique ones to fit the narrative and power level of your game!
