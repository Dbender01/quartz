Hydra Flail ,Weapon (flail), rare 
This flail’s spiked head is held in the jaws of a metal hydra figurehead. Whenever you score a critical hit with this weapon against a hostile creature, the weapon magically grows another spiked head. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls made with this magic weapon for each head the flail has (to a maximum of +6). After 1 hour, any head the flail grows in this way falls off and disappears.


Scarlet Scourge
Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)
This whip is made from the severed vertebrae of a slain
vampire’s victims. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and
damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
The whip siphons blood from creatures that it hits.
Whenever you hit a Small or larger living creature with
the whip that is not a construct, ooze, plant, or undead,
the bone blade at its end absorbs some of its blood and
gains 1 charge. The whip can hold up to 10 charges and
loses its charges whenever you finish a short or long
rest. While holding the whip, you can use a bonus action
to speak its command word to convert these charges
into healing energy. When you do, the whip loses all its
charges and you regain 2 hit points for each charge lost.
For every 5 charges the whip has, the muscle fibers
that hold it together loosen and add 5 feet to the
weapon’s reach.



Mistwalker Armor
Armor (leather), rare (requires attunement)
This dark leather armor releases thin wisps of fog from
its seams. While wearing this armor, you can use an
action to cast the fog cloud spell (2nd-level version) from
it. Once this property of the armor has been used, it
can’t be used again until the next dawn.
In addition, fog doesn’t obscure your vision, and while
you’re in opaque fog, you can use your movement to
teleport to an unoccupied space that you can see in the
fog. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to the
distance you teleport.

- Dusk Dagger, maybe 
- Spirit Sheath


Dusk Dagger Weapon (dagger), rarity varies This delicately curved dagger is ornamented with several crescent moon designs.

Locket of the Stolen Heart
Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)
The portrait inside this tiny golden locket transforms to
depict the creature you love most (living or dead) once
you attune to it. The love can be familial, romantic, or
otherwise devotional. If your feelings change and you
fall in love with a different creature while wearing the
locket, the portrait transforms again to reflect your current
feelings. While wearing the locket, you’re immune
to being charmed.
Curse. This locket is cursed, and if the creature you
love most is dead while you’re attuned to it, the curse
is extended to you. Even if the attunement ends or the
target of your love changes, the curse remains. While
cursed, your dreams are riddled with forlorn whispers
and memories from your lost love. If you die while
cursed in this way, you must also make a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw whenever you’re targeted by a spell or other
effect that returns you to life. On a failed save, your
soul is lost forever as it joins the soul of your lost love.
You remain cursed until you’re targeted by the greater
restoration or remove curse spell, if the creature you
love is restored to life, or if a creature casts the dream
spell and enters your dreams to dissolve the locket’s
illusions.
