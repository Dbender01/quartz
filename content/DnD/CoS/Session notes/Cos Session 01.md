#session
Open with each Player walking into the mists from their homeland

  

  

The players wander in the mist for what feels like hopeless hours. Eventually each one fades into unconscious sleep.

  

They awake in the Slavic woods meets seeping in through the trees.

  

As the sun began its descent behind the horizon, each vanishing ray heralded a hushed unease that settled upon the surroundings. A dense mist slithered and coiled around the gnarled trunks of the ancient trees that enveloped you. Its tendrils reached out hungrily, embracing every object that fell within its grasp. You became ensnared in its depths, an impenetrable darkness looming over you, swallowing all hues and distorting your perception.

  

You wandered blindly through these misty veils, unable to see anything but the faint outline of your own hands before you. Straying from the path, you miraculously avoided colliding with any trees or rocks. In fact, you couldn't even discern the ground beneath your feet. Lost in this disorienting darkness, time stretched on for what felt like hours, an eternity of aimless wandering. Until finally, a glimmer of hope emerged as the mist began to thin, revealing the faint silhouettes of distant trees.

  

As you ventured closer, the mist reluctantly retreated, unveiling a forest shrouded in an even deeper shade of green than before. The trees stood like guardians of the night, their branches twisting and tangling in unnatural and unsettling ways. They exuded an aura of malevolence, casting elongated shadows that seemed to dance with wicked intent.

  

Yet, amidst this unsettling scene, a figure lay motionless on a tree only ten feet ahead of you. Your senses caught a flicker of movement in their arms and legs, an eerie animation that defied reason. As you cautiously approached, a foul stench assaulted your nostrils, mingling with the dampness of the mist. The figure's pallid flesh clung to its bones, the visage of decay becoming apparent. In the dim light, its eyes gleamed with an unholy hunger, revealing the truth beneath its lifeless facade. It was no mere corpse, but a grotesque creature born from the realm of the dead—a zombie. What would you like to do?

The player can get their barrings and discuss where they are. Its the middle of the night and very hard to see even with darkvision.  They can walk around for a bit. A player can roll perception. anything with a  DC 14 or higher sees a child in the far distance.

  

As they get closer they see two children Rose and Thorn.

  

  

When the players first meet the siblings in front of the house, they tell the players that their parents are currently dealing with a monster in the basement.

  

  

  

  

  

**Death House**

Only a few months after Walter was born, Mrs. Durst completely lost her patience. She murdered the nanny and took Walter to the basement and sacrificed him without Mr. Durst’s knowledge. Because of the atrocity of this act, she attracted the notice of a Dark Power that cursed the entire house. Mrs. Durst and some of the other cultists present at the time were finally granted their immortality... by being turned into ghouls and ghasts. Mr. Durst, upon seeing what his wife had done, was overcome with guilt and grief and hanged himself in the basement. With no adults left to remember them, Rose and Thorne starved to death in their room.

In the conservatory/music room on the second floor, the players will come across an old dog hiding under the harpsichord. They’ll have to lure him out, but once he approaches, he’s very friendly

  

As written, Margaret should get violent if players try to go to the crib. I took this out. Instead, she simply asks them to be quiet since the baby is sleeping. When the players approach the bundle in the crib, it unfurls revealing nothing but the cloth and Margaret is gone.

  

  

  

**BASEMENT**

Don’t forget to mention the distant chanting that players can hear throughout the basement level.
