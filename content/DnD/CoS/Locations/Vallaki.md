[[Lady Fiona Wachter]] would love to sit down with the players and have a chat. She will freely reveal some information about [[Osybus]] mainly just the legends of him as a human and his fight with [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. If she can she will convince the players that the Baron is evil and is being manipulated by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and will promise more information if the players find a way to kill [[Izek Strazni]].

## N5. Market District
### The Cracked Anvil
A Smithy owned and operated by Dragomir Ulbrek

Dragomir is a blacksmith of...middling skill. He mostly makes hinges, nails, horseshoes, and other simple equipment. He has some ability to craft weapons (Simple Weapons made of metal--particularly spears and daggers) and knows how to make Chain armor (so Chain Shirt and Chain Mail). If you want him to have finer gear of any sort available, Dragomir pays hunters for any salvaged gear they find (from dead Adventurers) that he can repair and then resell to future adventurers--thus, any higher-grade weapons are of wildly differing designs, compared to his simple and utilitarian basic gear. As a result of this...whenever the PCs first visit his shop, he's going to eye their metal equipment...figuring he might end up with some of it before long.

Dragomir's wife, Magda, is a Fletcher. She can make bows of all sorts (but doesn't keep any in stock) and arrows. She and Dragomir are not really in love...their marriage is more of a businesses arrangement "because it made sense" than anything else.

### **Lukresh Tannery**

Run by Fatima Lukresh, a stout old woman who looks like she might have tanned her own skin along with the hides she works with.

Like Dragomir, she mostly works in mundane things--straps, harnesses, belts, etc. However, she knows how to make leather armor, and is the source of any local hunters who own a set. Like Magda, she doesn't keep a stock of leather armor around; if someone wants to buy some from her, they'll have to order it and wait for her to make it.

### **Endless Delight Clothiers**

Formerly "Alastroi Clothiers," this shop run by three siblings (Alek, Andrej, and Alana Alastroid--a Weaver, Cobbler, and Tailor respectively) was pressured into changing the name of the shop due to their heavy involvement with the Baron's festivals. They mostly sell simple clothing, but can make heavier winter-wear on order (source for the PCs to get cold weather gear for a trip up to the Amber Temple).

On visiting, they can usually be seen pulling apart decorations from prior festivals to try to recycle the materials for the next festival.

None of them are too thrilled with constantly being drug out into the rain for festivals...but all of the decorations and costumes they've been making have earned them a tidy sum of money. None of them like the new name of their shop, but it was better than ticking off the Baron.
