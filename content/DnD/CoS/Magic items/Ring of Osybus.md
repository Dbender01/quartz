### Retrieving the ring
The soul of a good aligned character needs to be presented before the ring in order to unlock it from its coffin in the amber temple.



This ring is a incomplete phylactery [[Osybus]] created when he was a human. Since his ascension as a dark power it has grown in power significantly and gives him a unique connection to the material plane that the other dark powers do not have. 

As the ring gains souls it grows in power, Particularly strong souls can be worth more than 1.

Any creature with a soul (humanoid) killed by the wielder of the ring absorbs it’s soul. The soul becomes a tattoo on the wielder. Beginning on the arms and expanding to the entire body.
  
Your Con is now 20. It has no effect if Con is higher than 20. 

The ring has a maximum number charges equal to 6 + the number of souls in the ring. The ring regains 1d6 + 1 charges when capturing a soul.
  
**(1 Charge) Steal Life.** You can use a bonus action to drain vigor from the soul and regain 4d8 hit points.

**(1 Charge per person ) Borrow Experience.** You can use a bonus action to bolster yourself and anyone else withing 60 ft with the soul’s life experience, making your next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw with advantage. If you don’t use this benefit before the start of your next turn, it is lost.

[Inflict Wounds](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/inflict-wounds) (At will)
[Summon Undead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/summon-undead) (2 charges)
[Blight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/blight)( 3 charges)
_[Circle of Death](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/circle-of-death)_ ( 4 charges)

As the ring gathers souls, it gains more abilities, that can come with a downside.

### Destroying the Ring 
The only way to destroy the
rod is to destroy Morath while your soul is contained
within the rod. When you do, use your original body’s
statistics and abilities for your soul, with the exception
that your hit point maximum is halved. Use the
archmage stat block for Morath’s soul. From outside the
rod, this combat resolves instantaneously, regardless of
how much time passed within the rod during the battle.
If you die while within the rod in this way, your soul is
lost to the Thousand Voices. If Morath dies, the rod is
destroyed and you return to your body with 1 hit point,
regardless of where your body is at the time.
