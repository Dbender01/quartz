#magicitem 
Wondrous item, common
As an action, you can shake it and speak its command word,
and walk along the boundary of a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The bell will remain floating in the air somewhere within that area for up to 8 hours. Whenever a Tiny or larger creature touches or enters the area specified the bell emits a loud ringing in your ears that’s audible to only you, provided that you’re within 1 mile of the bell and are on the same
plane of existence. The bell can only be used once per day and regains its use at dawn.
