![[HolySymbolfOfRavenKind.png]]


A secret organization of wereravens in Barovia that seek to oppose [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. Members often have strong interest in s√©ances, fortune-telling, secrets of the afterlife, sightings of mysterious creatures, metaphysical theories, and tales of the macabre.

The keepers believe that they can manipulate the threads of fate and use them to change their fortunes. They believe one day this power will be used to bring forth a champion to defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] once and for all.
