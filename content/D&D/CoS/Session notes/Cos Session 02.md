Session 01 recap

  

In the last session, the party entered the eerie mists of Barovia They fought off some zombies and then ventured into the dark woods at night. There, they stumbled upon two scared children named Rose and Thorn. The children pleaded for help, explaining that their parents were locked in the basement with a monster, and their baby brother, Walter, was somewhere upstairs.

  

Curiosity led the party into the Durst household, where they encountered unsettling sights. They found disturbing images etched on the walls and discovered a hidden room suggesting a cult's presence. On the second floor, they met a friendly dog named Lance. However, danger awaited them on the third floor in the form of menacing black animated armor. Emerson Biggens Jr. was gravely injured and nearly died. If not for the quick work of Dr Vocco Nevermore running up and down three flights of stairs in 12 seconds he might not have made it.

  

So far, the party has found little evidence of Walter or the parents, except for a family portrait on the second floor and a strange letter from [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. The secrets that lie within the Durst household still elude them.
