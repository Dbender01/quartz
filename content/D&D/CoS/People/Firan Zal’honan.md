Why Firan is here:
- He's heard Whispers of [[Osybus]]' power growing throughout the domains of dead. Firan continues to run into priests throughout his research. He is seeking to discover more Lore about the mysterious figure.
-
- He had a conversation with a priest in another domain of dread. About the their master [[Osybus]] and his ring. The Priest spoke of a champion that would free the group from their eternal chains. Someone would claim the mighty Ring of [[Osybus]] and their masters power would be able to manifest itself outside the domains of dread, and free the priests from their curse. 
- [[Osybus#^Prophecy]]


Looking my for  [[Ring of Osybus]]

Firan came into Barovia about 2 weeks before the party. We walked right through the village of Barovia but didn't stop, first visiting madam Eva. He then spent a few days there and then after in vallaki collecting some information. There he changed his face slightly and went by the name Khazan still appearing to be a wizard. He correctly assumed the city to be a powder keg and left after 3 days in the Bluewater in. Before doing so he did have a long conversation with the lady watcher but was unaware of the priest in her midst. It was there that he discovered a connection between [[osybus]] and the amber temple. He also heard rumors of someone living in the old wizard tower nearby [[Van Richten's Tower]]. Firan went to investigate and ran into [[Rudolph van Richten]]. After he spoke at length with Van ricten he could tell that [[Rudolph van Richten]] would cause a problem if Firan proceeded with his plan, so he hit him with a feeblemind spell and locked him in the bedroom of Khazan's tower.

After this Firan realized he needed more information on what was happening in Vallaki. He realized the cult that is gaining traction there could be related to [[Osybus]]. 

He is travelling under the guise of a [[Vistani]] named **Ratka** and is accompanied by a female guide named **Natasha**

When in [[Vallaki]] he changes his guise and Natasha waits outside in the encampment. Hs other guise is Rictavio.
