### Running the combat 
- druids are hiding in coffins
- The first druid to go should cast spike growth on the easiest path 
- Next 2 druids should try to cast conjure beasts 
- Druids should attempt to protect the tree

### Running at night
- The 4 druids are chanting in a circle around the wooden statue of strahd.
- From when they start chanting, see how long until the party starts to engage. The druids need 10 rounds to complete the transformation of the tree blight.
- 4 bezerkers, 2 hidden vine blights and a druid will spawn 2 dire wolves protect the druids. 


Druids Should at least summon 2 dire wolves more options include:
- 2 giant spiders 
- 8 Poisonous snakes
- 8 giant wolf spiders would also be cool
