Only a few months after Walter was born, Mrs. Durst completely lost her patience. She murdered the nanny and took Walter to the basement and sacrificed him without Mr. Durst’s knowledge. Because of the atrocity of this act, she attracted the notice of a Dark Power that cursed the entire house. Mrs. Durst and some of the other cultists present at the time were finally granted their immortality... by being turned into ghouls and ghasts. Mr. Durst, upon seeing what his wife had done, was overcome with guilt and grief and hanged himself in the basement. With no adults left to remember them, Rose and Thorne starved to death in their room.

**wood-framed portrait of the Durst family is in upper hall area 6**

  

  

  

Pantry includes a health kit and maybe a potion of healing

  

  

  

In the conservatory/music room on the second floor, the players will come across an old dog hiding under the harpsichord. They’ll have to lure him out, but once he approaches, he’s very friendly

  

  

  

As written, Margaret should get violent if players try to go to the crib. I took this out. Instead, she simply asks them to be quiet since the baby is sleeping. When the players approach the bundle in the crib, it unfurls revealing nothing but the cloth and Margaret is gone.

  

  

  

**BASEMENT**

Don’t forget to mention the distant chanting that players can hear throughout the basement level.

  

  

  

  

  

Golden ring from the dead cultist contains a fragment of a soul in it. It is a commoner from Barovia. Sebastian Florea, a carpenter from the village, had gambling debts.

3 charges are in the ring as if from a soul cage spell
