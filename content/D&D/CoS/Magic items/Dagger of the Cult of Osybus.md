**Dagger of the Cult of Osybus**

_Weapon (dagger), rare (requires attunement)_

This unique and sinister-looking dagger is far longer than the typical daggers adventurers might carry. Its blade is sleek, dark, and adorned with intricate, macabre engravings. Once attuned to the Dagger of the Cult of Osybus, it becomes a hauntingly lifelike tattoo etched onto your body, hidden from view until summoned.

- **Weapon Type:** Dagger
- **Damage:** 1d6 piercing
- **Properties:** Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)
- **Magic Bonus:** +1

_**Summoning and Dismissal:**_ As a free action, you can summon or dismiss the Dagger of the Cult of Osybus once per turn. When summoned, the tattoo vanishes from your body and reappears in your hand. You can dismiss it as a free action as long as the dagger is within 60 feet of you, causing it to return as a tattoo on your body.

_**Tattoo of the Fallen:**_ When you use this dagger to kill a creature, a tattoo of that creature will mysteriously appear somewhere on your body. The dagger gains one charge, with a maximum capacity of 5 charges.

_**Spells:**_ The Dagger of the Cult of Osybus has the power to channel its stored charges into the following spells:

- **False Life (1 charge):** You can expend 1 charge to cast the False Life spell, granting yourself temporary hit points.
    
- **Inflict Wounds (+6 to hit, 2 charges):** You can expend 2 charges to cast the Inflict Wounds spell, delivering a powerful necrotic touch to your target.
    
- **Blindness/Deafness (DC 14, 3 charges):** You can expend 3 charges to cast the Blindness/Deafness spell, potentially blinding or deafening a creature of your choice.
    

_**Curse of Osybus:**_ This item bears a malevolent curse. Once attuned, you cannot willingly un-attune from it. At dusk of each day, if the dagger does not have 5 charges, you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC of 13. If you fail, you suffer 1d6 necrotic damage, and your maximum hit points are reduced by that amount for the next 24 hours. You can consume 1 charge from the dagger to completely negate this damage. The curse of Osybus is relentless, and its grip on you is inescapable once attuned.
